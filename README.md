# PoloniexLiveFeed Bookmarklet
This is a tiny javascript function that takes the live Buy and Sell prices, and shoves them into the Buy and Sell input's.
Basically, If you are wanting to keep the absolute latest buying/selling price in your buy/sell price input (to buy/sell it at that EXACT price you want!), you may use this function as a Bookmarklet to keep the live feed for you, so all you have to do is click buy/sell whenever you are ready!

## To Create A Bookmarklet
1. Copy the code from "LiveFeed.js"
2. Create a new bookmark in your browser
3. Give your Bookmark a name, I.E. 'PoloniexLiveFeed'
4. Paste the copied script into the "URL" section of the bookmark
5. Save!

## To use the Bookmarklet
1. Navigate on over to Poloniex.com
2. Click on your shiny new Bookmarklet
3. Watch that buy/sell price automagically update real time for you!

**Feel free to use this as you wish, but if you use this to make money, please give credit where credit is due.**

Happy Trading!
