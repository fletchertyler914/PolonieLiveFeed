# PoloniexLiveFeed
This is a tiny javascript function that takes the live Buy and Sell prices, and shoves them into the Buy and Sell input's.
Basically, If you are wanting to keep the absolute latest buying/selling price in your buy/sell price input (to buy/sell it at that EXACT price you want!), you may use this function as a Bookmarklet to keep the live feed for you, so all you have to do is click buy/sell whenever you are ready!

To use this, just copy the code from "LiveFeed.js", create a bookmark and give it a name, and paste this script into the "URL" section.
This will give you a "Bookmarklet".
Navigate on over to Poloniex.com, click on your shiny new Bookmarklet, and watch that buy/sell price automagically update real time for you!

Feel free to use this as you wish, but if you use this to make money, please give credit where credit is due.

Happy Trading!
